# Time-Series-Forecasting-with-RNN
Time Series Forecasting with Recurrent Neural Network

## Overview

This project demonstrates the application of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) for time series forecasting, specifically in predicting electric production over time. The dataset used is 'Electric_Production.csv', containing monthly electric production values.

## Files and Directories

- **/content/Electric_Production.csv:** Dataset containing electric production values.
- **/notebooks/Time_Series_Forecasting_with_RNN.ipynb:** Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.
- **/results/:** Folder containing the generated model predictions and visualizations.
- **/README.md:** This file, providing an overview of the project.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Required Python libraries are listed in the 'requirements.txt' file.

## Setup and Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
